## Introduction

This Dockerfile adds experimental OCaml language support for Sourcegraph. 

Thanks to the [freebroccolo/ocaml-language-server](https://github.com/freebroccolo/ocaml-language-server) project for providing the language server that's wrapped by `lsp-adapter` in this image.

Check out the [Sourcegraph docs](http://about.sourcegraph.com/docs/code-intelligence/experimental-language-servers) for information on enabling this language server for your Sourcegraph installation.
